      <h2>Singapore: Our Food</h2>

        <h2>A Brief Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Singapore is a tiny island that can easily be missed on the map, but I assure you
          that it very much exists and lies right below Malaysia. It is a country with a unique
          blend of history, ethnicities, and culture - though our recent claim to fame has been
          the home of "Crazy Rich Asians". We also do have a really cool infinity pool on top of
          a six-star hotel built on reclaimed land, and an astounding (man-made) waterfall inside
          our airport. However, the real MVP is the food, something that every tourist will confirm.
          Singaporean cuisine reflects the harmony of its main ethnic groups - Indians, Malays,
          and Chinese - though the migration of other ethnic groups do have significant influence
          on our food over the last decade or so. Our food is our pride and joy, so much that we constantly
          have friendly battles with our neighbours (looking at you, Malaysia) over the ownership of our
          recipes.

    <h2>Breakfast</h2>
    <br>

    <p>
      The typical Singaporean breakfast consists of coffee, toast, and soft-boiled eggs
      with a generous dash of dark soy sauce and pepper. However, the magical element is
      the filling in the toast - kaya. Kaya is a sweet coconut jam made with coconut milk,
      eggs, and sugar. It is popular in the Southeast Asia region, and different cultures
      have made subtle additions to the jam over the years. The Peranakan Nyonya
      kaya has a rich green colour, while the Hainanese kaya is slightly more brown - details
      that no one really notice in the morning when they munch on their toast and try to stay
      awake.

    <h2>Lunch</h2>

    <p>
      Singaporeans cannot live without rice or noodles, and either (sometimes both!) staple
      makes an appearance during mealtimes.

      Nasi Ayam, or Chicken Rice, is a classic comfort dish for Singaporeans. It consists of
      many key players, each with a crucial role in ensuring the success of the dish. The rice
      is cooked with chicken stock and spices, and the chilli is blended with tomatoes and ginger.
      The chicken is the belle of the ball, and is prepared in many ways. Hainanese chicken rice
      demands for the chicken to be poached, while the Indonesians fry and smash it. I personally
      enjoy watching my fried chicken get smashed before it is served to me, but each to their own.

    <h2>Dinner</h2>

    <p>
      Have you ever been in the mood for rice noodles and egg noodles, that is dry but not soupy,
      and has an abundance of flavour? You'd probably want to give Hokkien Noodles a go. The noodles
      are cooked in a special broth made from prawn heads and shells, and usually comes with seafood.

    <h2>Snacks</h2>

    <p>
      As said earlier, Singaporeans live and breathe carbs, and one of our hobbies
      is to come up with ways of incorporating carbs into our food outside of the three
      main meals. Enter curry puffs, the southeast asian sister of empanadas. A fried dough
      case with spiced potatoes, chicken, and egg - there are plain potato versions and sardine
      curry puffs too!

    <h2>Drinks</h2>

    <p>
      'Teh tarik' means pulled tea in Malay - you pour your tea from one cup to another in an elongated
      fashion, making the tea nice and frothy. It is also made with either condensed milk or evaporated milk,
      because we really, really like our sugar. Having teh is not just drinking tea - it makes up the fabric of
      society. Singaporeans can easily get through four cups of teh tarik a day on average, especially when
      hanging out with friends at a coffee shop at 3am. One would think that the coffee shops would be empty
      at such ungodly hours, but that is when the country really thrives, thanks to a supremely unhealthy ingestion of
      caffeine.
